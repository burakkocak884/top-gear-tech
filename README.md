	## Usage

Upon running 'rails server'('rails s' is a shorter version) in your terminal(assuming that rails is installed in you system), open your browser, and insert "http://localhost:3000" (the port number(3000) can be different depends on your operating system). Your terminal will display post number once "rails" is running properly. Once you insert "http://localhost:3000" into browser's url box, you will be presented a welcome message,an options( "log in", "sign up", or "log in via GitHub account"). Next step depends on you selection. The app will guide you to diffirent pages. You can sign up to create a user name or log in with an existing user name. Note that, A Valid Email address/Username/Password when signing up and non-existing username/email when logging in are required. Since the app first relays on User Authentication, Email/password is validated. Once logged in, you can add your garage(s) in database. Creating an appointment associated with a customer and vehicle would be next step.  There will be options available when desire to update and/or delete a garage/appointment/customer/vehicle.
In order to user Javascript feature to create a garage, go to url: "/garages/new" manually. Once a new graage is created, you will be back in "/garages" path. "let's pull the data in different way" button is where you get most of JAvaScript feature. By clicking that. you can see different pages without refereshing  browser. It is JAvaScript Magic. You are good to go. 
Have fun managing you rental properties!!!
